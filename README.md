# informationRedactor
This is a simple credit card information censoring program

This program takes what is currently copied to the users clipboard and uses regular expression to match any possible credit card numbers. It then redacts the first 12 numbers and copies it back to the clipboard to save the user time if they want to change many credit card numbers fast.

## How to use
* Download the python application
* Copy any text
* Run informationRedactor.py in Command Prompt
* If credit card numbers exist, it will notify you that the new numbers have been copied to clipboard and will show the redacted versions of the numbers
